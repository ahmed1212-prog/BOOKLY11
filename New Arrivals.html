                    The ghost of the King of Denmark tells his son Hamlet to avenge his murder by killing the new king,

                <h5>The Power of Habit <span> by Charles Duhigg </span></h5>
                <p>
                    Habits are the water in our daily lives â€“ they are the unconscious behavioral patterns that drive
                    how we spend most of our time.
                    If we want to reshape our lives, we need to consciously recognize the habits that drive our lives
                    and do
                    the hard work required to change the ones that are no longer serving us.

                <h5>Don Quixote<span> by Miguel de Cervantes </span></h5>
                <p>
                    Don Quixote teaches us that life is to be challenged. That passion and discipline of a determined
                    soul are a foundational element of being a leader. Quixote does not accept current reality.
                    He forces his creative imagery, his commitment, and his happiness on it.
